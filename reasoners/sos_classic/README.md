# ðŸ”¢ Generating classic search data with Stream-of-Search code

We adapt the stand-alone SoS code (https://github.com/kanishkg/stream-of-search) to generate reasoning paths from classic search algorithms (BFS, DFS) in the Countdown, with minor modifications. 

We also preprocess the data from SoS format to our CoT-style format.
